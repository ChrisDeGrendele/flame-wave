To keep track of flamewave problem setups, analysis scripts, and job scripts for Berkeley Lab


flame_convergence - Convergence input files to hopefully show that flamespeed converges to a certain value as we add more layers of AMR. (Reaction Network = ignition_simple)

flame_convergence_sdc - Same, but instead of strang, we use SDC. (reaction network = ignition_simple)

flame_strangvssdc - for comparing strang vs sdc with an ignition_simple reaction network.
